Files for Homework 1 of Exploratory Data Analysis course. There are 5 R files and 4 PNG files.
The R iles plot each one of the plots, and there is one that does all of them. The individual ones were created from the long one.
The files write the data for the selected dates/times to a specific file, such that it is possible to avoid the read/transform part.
